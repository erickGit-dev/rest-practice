### Practice REST-API
 This is a personal practice creating an eCommerce app using the followings technologies:
- Node.js (Express.js)
- React.js
- Typescript 
- MongoDB (Mongoose)

### Why?
 This app will help to get the knowledge about how the technologies works together using APIs.
 
 Still in development...

### Backend 
The entire application uses Typescript and JSON and the controllers endpoints are validated
 The backend have the followings endpoints 
- User authentication using JWT and middleware validator
post - /sign-up
post - /log-in
post - /log-out
get - /users
put - /update-user/:id 
delete - /delete-user/:id

- Products managements 
post - /add-products
get - /get-products
get - /get-products/:id
put - /update-products/:id
delete - /delete-products/:id

### Frontend
 The Client app was made using Typescript applying best practices like:
- Type safety 
- Null safety 
- Enviroment variables
- React hook useEffect
- Error validator

And all the components was created from scratch using:
- CSS modules
- CSS nesting 
- CSS variables 
- Web toolkit 
- Media querys

The client app is intended to be responsive...
